🚗 For Smart Tech: Training a Car to Drive Around Two Different Tracks

## Overview
This project involves training a self-driving car to navigate two distinct tracks. We've focused on capturing detailed training data to enhance the car's ability to handle different driving conditions.

## Data Collection 📊
- Link to Uploaded Data: [Training Data](https://github.com/KyleMcQ/Images_CA2)
- We captured images and data at every frame rather than every keystroke. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive dataset.
- The vehicle was driven around each track at a maximum speed of 15mph, optimizing the efficiency of data collection.

## Track Details 🛣️
### Track 1
- A standard oval track designed to test basic navigation and speed control.
  
### Track 2
- A more complex layout with varied turns and elevations.

## Observations and Notes 📝
- The consistent speed of 15mph ensured uniform data quality.
- The difference in track complexity provided a diverse range of driving scenarios, crucial for training a robust model.

## Conclusion and Future Work 💡
- The project has laid a strong foundation for developing a reliable self-driving model.
- Future work will focus on refining the AI algorithms to handle more unpredictable environments.
