🚗 For Smart Tech: Training a Car to Drive Around Two Different Tracks

## Overview
This project involves training a self-driving car to navigate two distinct tracks. We've focused on capturing detailed training data to enhance the car's ability to handle different driving conditions.

- We captured images and data at every frame rather than every keystroke. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive dataset.
- The vehicle was driven around each track at a maximum speed of 15mph, optimizing the efficiency of data collection.

## Track Details 🛣️
### Track 1
- A standard oval track designed to test basic navigation and speed control.
- Watch the Track 1 experience: [Track 1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5rZPQ5IoYc?si=yIbXPffJpFS2GeZu)
### Track 2
- A more complex layout with varied turns and elevations.

## Observations and Notes 📝
- The consistent speed of 15mph ensured uniform data quality.
- The difference in track complexity provided a diverse range of driving scenarios, crucial for training a robust model.
- We noted that shadows in track 2 caused the car to avoid them so we needed more data within shadows.
- We then took note of the surroundings on track 2 and thought how would a real car work. We trained specifically within road lines and stayed away from barriers etc.

## Conclusion and Future Work 💡
- The project has laid a strong foundation for developing a reliable self-driving model.
- Future work will focus on refining the AI algorithms to handle more unpredictable environments.
